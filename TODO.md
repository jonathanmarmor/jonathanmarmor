# TODO

- Correct made up registers in known_instruments
- Correct short names in known_instruments
- Add more instruments to known_instruments
- Need to be able to have more than one inst starting on the same position (maybe this is possible now?)
- Support float pitchclasses as cents deviation in notation (probably in lyrics field)
- Automatically detect passages that need ottava transpositions
- Write a test to make sure output in each instrument is in the instrument's range
